a document to capture the "fleshing out of features" of the app

so far, this document only deals with the use cases available assuming the user is already authenticated/logged-in.  the
app will need to handle the full life-cycle in the end, so keep that in mind. really, all of the use case will hang from
a single point ("use case", or "shared-todo", if you like). the implementation should be able to run forever,
ultimately; possibly even beyond version bumps, if we're really that entheusiastic (we are! right? I mean,
versioning/updates/upgrades are inherent in the UX, no?  We talk to the user about them in the app so they're aware and
understanding too, why should those components be special?)...

BEGIN!
====

The app will be multi-tenant (multi-user).  Users can create and manage lists of tasks.  Tasks can be copmleted, and
have an associated deadline.  Further, task lists can be shared between users, each with their own access permissions,
managed by the owner.

Task Lists
====
Task lists are an ordered list of tasks.  They are owned by a single user, who can manage its lifecycle and the
permissions of users it is shared with.

The configurable permissions of a user when shared a task list are:
 - can manage tasks
 - can manage task completion
 -(SKIP THIS ONE! unnecessary complexty/loose-ends; doesn't quite make sense privacy/security wise) can request re-share of the task list | can re-share task list (with permission level or lower)

Managing task lists
----
Create a task list.
Share a task list with a user with certain permissions.
Edit the permissions of a user to a shared task list.
Stop sharing a task list with a user.
Delete a task list.
Hide (archive) a task list.
Unhide (unarchive) a task list.
Duplicate a task list.

Managing tasks
----
Add a task to a task list.
Duplicate a task of a task list
Delete a task of a task list.
Edit a task of a task list.
Hide (archive) a task of a task list.
Unhide (unarchive) a task of a task list.


User Account
====
Users have a unique alphanumeric name, with the ability to set a preferred vanity version that allows interspersing
special characters as desired, which the system will effectively otherwise ignore except when displaying the name.
User accounts will be identified by an email address and authenticated by a password.

Managing a user account
----
Change account password.
Change vanity name preference.
Delete account and all data.
Export all account data.
Edit biographical information (name, location, gender).
Generate new random avatar.
